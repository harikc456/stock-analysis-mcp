This project provides a MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that uses data from the NSE India API. It includes technical indicators and Reddit sentiment analysis for Indian stocks.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## How to run locally

1.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
    
    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
    REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_reddit_client_id
    REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_reddit_client_secret
    REDDIT_USER_AGENT=stock-analysis-mcp/1.0
    ```
    
    To get Reddit API credentials:
    1. Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
    2. Click "Create App" or "Create Another App"
    3. Fill in the form:
       - Name: stock-analysis-mcp (or any name you prefer)
       - App type: Select "script"
       - Description: (optional)
       - About URL: (leave blank)
       - Redirect URI: http://localhost:8000 (or any valid URL)
    4. Click "Create App"
    5. Copy the client ID (under the app name) and client secret

2.  **Build and run the services:**

    ```bash
